> **Git Flow Branching Model** — Implemented with pure Git, no additional tools required

A Claude Code skill that helps you follow the Git Flow workflow. Supports custom branch names, interactive operations, and is fully portable.

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Method 1:

```shell
npx skills add https://github.com/hughedward/gitflow-skills --skill gitflow
```

#### Method 2:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hughedward/gitflow-skills.git /tmp/gitflow-skills

# Copy the skill to your Claude Code skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r /tmp/gitflow-skills/skills/gitflow ~/.agents/skills
ln -s ~/.agents/skills/gitflow ~/.claude/skills/

# Done! Type /gitflow in Claude Code to use it
```

### Basic Usage

**Type in Claude Code:(All you need to do)**

```
/gitflow [balabala]
```

The skill will guide you through Git Flow operations.

You can optionally configure a `.gitflow` file in your project root:

```ini
# Git Flow Configuration
# This file is generated by setup_gitflow.sh
# Modify these values to customize your branch names

[gitflow "branch"]
    master = main
    develop = develop

[gitflow "prefix"]
    feature = feature/
    release = release/
    hotfix = hotfix/
```

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pure Git Implementation** | No need to install git-flow-avh or other tools |
| **Interactive Menu** | Friendly command-line interface, no need to memorize complex commands |
| **Custom Configuration** | Support for custom branch names (e.g., `dev` instead of `develop`) |
| **Status Visualization** | Understand your Git Flow status at a glance |
| **Regression Testing** | Built-in test suite to ensure script reliability |

## Usage Guide (Read to the end)

Official documentation: https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

### Initialize Repository

```bash
# Ensure main branch exists
git checkout main

# Create develop branch
git checkout -b develop

# Push to remote
git push -u origin main
git push -u origin develop
```

Or use the helper script:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/gitflow/scripts/setup_gitflow.sh
```

### Develop New Features

```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/user-auth

# ... develop code ...

# Merge back to develop when done
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/user-auth
git branch -d feature/user-auth
```

### Release Version

```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/1.0.0

# ... release preparation ...

# Merge to main and tag
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git branch -d release/1.0.0

# Push tags
git push origin main
git push origin develop
git push origin 1.0.0
```

### Production Hotfix

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/1.0.1

# ... fix bug ...

# Merge to main and tag
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.0.1
git tag -a 1.0.1 -m "Hotfix version 1.0.1"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.0.1
git branch -d hotfix/1.0.1
```

## 🦭: **Above is just knowledge, you don't actually need to worry about anything**

**Just type in Claude Code:** Let the skill handle the rest

```
/gitflow
```

## Helper Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `setup_gitflow.sh` | Initialize Git Flow repository |
| `gitflow_helper.sh` | Interactive operation menu |
| `gitflow_status.sh` | Display current Git Flow status |

---

## Branch Structure

| Branch | Purpose | Source | Merge To |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| `main` / `master` | Production | - | - |
| `develop` | Development integration | `main` | - |
| `feature/*` | New feature development | `develop` | `develop` |
| `release/*` | Release preparation | `develop` | `develop`, `main` |
| `hotfix/*` | Production emergency fixes | `main` | `develop`, `main` |

## Git Flow Philosophy

Git Flow is a branching model strategy proposed by [Vincent Driessen](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

**Core concept:** Git Flow is a set of branch management conventions, **not a specific tool**. Understanding the underlying Git commands allows you to use it in any environment without depending on additional software.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Git Flow Philosophy  →  Implemented with native git  ✓ │
│  Git Flow Tool  →  Optional, not required (optional)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Configuration

The `.gitflow` configuration file in the project root stores branch naming preferences:

```ini
[gitflow "branch"]
    master = main
    develop = develop
[gitflow "prefix"]
    feature = feature/
    release = release/
    hotfix = hotfix/
```

All helper scripts will automatically read and respect this configuration.

## System Requirements

- Git 2.0+
- Bash 4.0+

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to install git-flow-avh tool?**

A: No. This skill implements all features using pure Git commands.

**Q: Can I customize branch names?**

A: Yes. Modify the `.gitflow` configuration file.

**Q: What if develop branch doesn't exist?**

A: Run `git checkout main && git checkout -b develop` to create it.
